A CRUD application for managing and monitoring sensors. Built using Java (11–21), Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Spring Security.

🧩 Overview
This is a backend system that allows users to manage sensor data with full CRUD functionality. The application supports role-based access control, database persistence, and optional Docker deployment. An advanced module includes integration with a statistics service that collects and stores daily sensor reports.

📦 Features  
✅ CRUD Operations for managing sensors.  
🔐 Role-Based Access Control :
Administrator: Full access (create, read, update, delete).  
Viewer: Read-only access.  
🔍 Search Functionality : by name and model with partial match support.  
🗂️ Predefined Sensor Types & Units from the database.  
📘 Validation Rules on all fields.  
🧪 Optional:  
Swagger API documentation  
Database migrations (Flyway / Liquibase)  
Docker support  
Statistics Service (daily reports)

Support for Flyway or Liquibase to version-control database schema changes.

✅ Docker Support
Application can be containerized using Docker. See docker-compose.yml for multi-container setup.

🔁 Advanced Feature:  
Statistics Service
A separate microservice that:

Fetches sensor data every day at 02:00 AM.
Stores statistics in a dedicated database:
Total number of sensors.
Count per type.
Allows querying statistics for a given date range (e.g., from 2023-12-01 to 2023-12-10).
